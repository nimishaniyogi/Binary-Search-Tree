# Binary-Search-Tree

Binary search trees (BST), also called as ordered or sorted binary trees, are a particular type of container: data structures that store "items" (such as numbers, names etc.) in memory. They allow fast lookup, addition and removal of items, and can be used to implement either dynamic sets of items, or lookup tables that allow finding an item by its key (e.g., finding the phone number of a person by name).

This program repeatedly prompt its user for commands, and be capable of handling the following commands:

a)	insert 𝑣 – To insert an occurrence of the value 𝑣 in the underlying tree. The depth in the resulting tree of the new node created should be displayed as output for this command.

b)	delete 𝑣 – To delete some occurrence of the value 𝑣 from the underlying tree, if one such exists. If the delete operation is successful, the depth of the deleted node in the original tree should be produced as output. Otherwise, no output should be produced for this command.

c)	search 𝑣 – To search for some occurrence of the value 𝑣 in the underlying tree. If the search operation is successful, the depth of the node found in the tree should be produced as output. Otherwise, no output should be produced for this command.

d)	clear – To delete all existing nodes from the underlying tree, resulting in an empty tree. No output should be produced for this command.

e)	show – To display the entire tree horizontally. Nodes should be “nested” under their parent, in the left-to-right order, and nodes at the same depth should have the same indentation. See the following example display of the given tree:

f)	exit – To terminate the program.
 
Run the file: 

>java –jar file_name.jar 
Or 

>javac file_name.java 

>java file_name

The command prompt, NetBeans IDE, eclipse IDE can be used to execute the program.
